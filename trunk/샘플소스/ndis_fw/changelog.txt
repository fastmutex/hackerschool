* ndis_hk\hooked_fn.c: fixed bug with BSOD on XP/2003 startup

Thanks to OlegP


2003-05-21: new version released!

What's new? Not so much. I tried to make ndis_hk driver as generic hooking 
engine. Filter drivers can attach to hooking driver several times using
"layered" architecture.

A lot of changes in ndis_hk.

Few changes in ndis_flt. One of the most important thing is ability to
send network packets to network or to TCP/IP protocol driver. As example
TCP RST on DENY can be sent. See ndis_flt\packet.c

Thanks to Jan, Igor and all who interested in this project!
